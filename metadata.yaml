description: Florence Hartley's exhaustive guide The Ladies' Book of Etiquette is
  a fascinating read. Offering an inside look at the mores and conventions of the
  post-Civil War era, the book also offers handy tips for gracious manners that stand
  the test of time. The book also offers beauty techniques and concoctions based on
  common household ingredients, an idea that's making a comeback today.
